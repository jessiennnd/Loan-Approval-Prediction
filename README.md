# Loan Approval Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Loan Approval dataset** (20,000 records) containing demographic, financial, and credit-related information.  
The main goal is to build and evaluate **classification models** that predict whether a loan application will be **approved or denied**.  

The tasks completed include:  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ preparing the dataset for analysis.  
- **Logistic Regression** â€“ applying a linear classification model to predict loan approval.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** â€“ testing another supervised learning method to compare results.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information
The dataset is a modified version of the *Synthetic Dataset for Risk Assessment and Loan Approval Modeling* shared by **Lorenzo Zoppelletto**.  
It comprises **20,000 records** of personal and financial data, providing a comprehensive basis for predictive modeling.

## Workflow

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant or redundant features.  
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.  
- Scaled numerical features for KNN.  

### Logistic Regression
- Trained a logistic regression model using training data.  
- Evaluated with **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Used **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to identify the most important features.  

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Performed **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** for feature selection.  
- Started with **1-NN classifier** and evaluated training vs. testing performance.  
- Identified potential **overfitting** issues in small-k values.  
- Conducted **Grid Search with cross-validation** to find the optimal `k`.  
- Visualized accuracy trends across different values of `k`.  
- Compared distance metrics: **Euclidean, L1 (Manhattan), and Cosine**.  
- Selected the best configuration based on **F1-score and cross-validation accuracy**.

## Key Insight
Logistic Regression performed slightly better overallâ€”its predictions on testing data were more accurate and balanced. KNN was close but a tiny bit lower, especially in F1-score. It may be due to Logistic Regression can capture the overall patterns more efficiently with selected features, while KNN depends on local similarities and can be affected by data density or noise.
